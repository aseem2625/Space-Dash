# Space-Dash
Space Dash game for corona venturesity.com hackathon
-Author: Aseem Gupta. Game Prototyping done for CORONA "Game Warriors" hackathon-venturesity.com
Had enough Fun over the week while learning and creating a prototype

#Hackathon DELIVERABLES and some screenshots:
- Check "Extras" folder.
- 2 apks are attaches. Other apk has facebooks social share and sharing might only work for those facebook accounts 
which are added in the app-developers in through my fb app manager(because the app is in development phase and not published on google play) 

(Package name of the app is com.whiteshadow.geometricfunslide and geometricFunSlide was the first name I thought for this game, which now is Space Dash. This package name is must inorder to publish to facebook)

#Rules
Reach the Coin without touching any object in limited time

#Controls
Use accelerometer to control the player
Or in case you're going too fast then give impulse to player in opposite direction by clicking in opposite direction

#Future map:
Source file for graphics is also in the Extras folder so that anyone who wants to learn can modify it from there
