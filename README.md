# Space-Dash
Space Dash game for corona venturesity.com hackathon
-Author: Aseem Gupta. Game Prototyping done for CORONA "Game Warriors" hackathon-venturesity.com
Had enough Fun over the week while learning and creating a prototype

#Hackathon DELIVERABLES and some screenshots:
- Check "Extras" folder.
- 2 apks are attaches. Other apk has facebooks social share and sharing might only work for those facebook accounts 
which are added in the app-developers in through my fb app manager(because the app is in development phase and not published on google play) 

(Package name of the app is com.whiteshadow.geometricfunslide and geometricFunSlide was the first name I thought for this game, which now is Space Dash. This package name is must inorder to publish to facebook)

#Rules
* Reach the Coin without touching any spikes/moving object in limited time

#Controls
* Use accelerometer to control the player
* Or if  you're going sliding fast then give impulse to player in opposite direction by tapping in opposite direction


#Graphics
* Inkscape - free open source tool for graphic. I did all graphics in inkscape
* TeturePacker - Pro Trial version for corona- Packing graphics

#Key Points of game
1. Original perspective library tweaked for hero alignment at 30% left at screen instead of 50%
2. Screen capture and facebook share
3. Physics
4. Sensors
5. Accelerometer
6. Audio - Music and Effects
7. Sprite Sheet Animation and transition based coron animation
8. Reading and writing score
9. Particle emitter
10. Coordinates are multi resolution
11. Corona Composure GUI
12. Screen shot on game over and publish on Facebook. Currently game is registered for "prototype game fun slide"(initial name of my prototype) on facebook for the API key and I am not sure if you'll be able to published post as facebook restrict in-developement apps activites to be seen only developers.
(SCREENSHOTS are attached in extras folder)

#Future map:
In case anyone wants to learn or extend game for educational purpose then you're free to take the game art source file in Extras folder. Player die and happy-win graphics aren't there in game but are drawn in svg file. Make sure you abide by License.

#Duration of prototype development
~30-40 hrs over 1 week duration



#TODO:
* Score Manager is implemented. But due to time constraint, assigning score according to player accomplishments are yet to be added
* Add levels. For another kind of level idea, refer the image attatched in Extras folder
* Graphics optimization is done only for menu sprites. To be done for others
